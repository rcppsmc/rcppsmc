Rcpp Bindings for Sequential Monte Carlo

### Summary

This package provides R with access to the 
[Sequential Monte Carlo Template Classes](https://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v030i06/) 
by Johansen (Journal of Statistical Software, 2009, v30, i6).

At present, four additional examples have been added, and the first example
from the JSS paper has been extended. Further integration and extensions are
planned.

For support and discussion please make us of the [rcppsmc mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/rcppsmc).
